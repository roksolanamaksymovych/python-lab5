This code defines a simple fighting simulation between two fighters using classes in Python.

1. **Fighter class:**
   - Represents a fighter with a name, health, and damage per attack.
   - The `attack` method reduces the opponent's health.
   - The `is_alive` method checks if the fighter is still in the fight.
   - The `get_name` method returns the fighter's name.

2. **Fight class:**
   - Represents a fight between two fighters.
   - The `start_fight` method simulates the fight until one fighter is defeated.
   - Returns the name of the winner.

3. **main function:**
   - Creates two fighters with different health and damage.
   - Initiates a fight between them and prints the name of the winner.

In the provided example, the program creates two fighters, `Fighter1` and `Fighter2`, gives them initial health and damage values, makes them fight, and then prints the name of the winner.
